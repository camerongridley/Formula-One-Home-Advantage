<h1>Analysis and Results</h1>
<h3>For All Drivers Across All Seasons</h3>
Mean of home_means 10.0
Variance of home_means 21.0
Standard Deviation of home_means 10.0
Mean of away_means 9.0
Variance of away_means 11.0
Standard Deviation of away_means 9.0
t-test (ind) for home and away means: p=0.052, t_score=1.942


<h2>Study Limitations</h2>
Definition of "home" refers to an entire country! For small countries this might be accurate, for large countries might be a poor definition.
